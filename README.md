## Hello!üëã

Hello! I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science (B2). I plan to post both my college assignments and personal projects here.

## ‚ù§Ô∏èHobbies

I love watching sports, especially baseball. In my downtime, I also enjoy relaxing by watching Netflix and YouTube. Recently, I've developed an interest in DIY, and I'd like to explore more in this area. With the growing trend in micro-programming and IoT, I'd be excited to post about such topics here.

## Interests
- üé•**Watching videos on YouTube or Netflix.**
  
- ‚öæÔ∏è**Watching sports games, particularly baseball, especially MLB. I really enjoy watching Shohei Ohtani play. ITFDB!!**

- üéÆ**Playing games (like Pawapuro and Smashers),but I try not to play them often because once I start, it's hard to stop and it gets frustrating.**
  
- üí™**I enjoy strength training.My goal is to exceed a one-rep max of 220 lbs. My favorite exercises are barbell squats and overhead presses.**
