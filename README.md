## Hello!üëã

Hello! I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science (B2). I plan to post both my college assignments and personal projects here.

## ‚ù§Ô∏èHobbies

I love watching sports, especially baseball. In my downtime, I also enjoy relaxing by watching Netflix and YouTube. Recently, I've developed an interest in DIY, and I'd like to explore more in this area. With the growing trend in micro-programming and IoT, I'd be excited to post about such topics here.
